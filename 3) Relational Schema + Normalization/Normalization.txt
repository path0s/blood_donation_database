Normalization:
1NF: The schema is in 1NF because there are no multi-valued, composite, or combined attributes.
2NF: For tables with a primary key composed of a single attribute, the test is unnecessary (DONOR, BLOOD_BAG, BLOOD_BANK, REQUEST, DOCTOR, PATIENT).
3NF: All relationships are in 3NF because there are no transitive functional dependencies.

Normalized Relational Schema:
The normalized relational schema is the same as its initial state.
