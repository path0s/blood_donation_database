We want to create a management system for the Emilia-Romagna region (for simplicity, we will consider only 4 regions: Bologna, Ferrara, Ravenna, Modena) using a database called 'blood_donation' to track the general and normal path that a whole blood donation follows to reach the patient. For the sake of efficiency, this system records information only about donors who meet the necessary requirements for donation, namely, being between 18 and 70 years old, weighing at least 50 kg, leading a healthy lifestyle, enjoying good health, and having undergone additional blood checks. 

The system also sets additional limits on the donor's gender and age: a fertile woman cannot make more than 2 donations per year. The last condition is that the time interval between two whole blood donations must not be less than 90 days; consequently, the maximum number of donations in a year is set at 4.
a) Therefore, the system must keep track of information related to the DONOR, including their ID (essential for unique identification), name, surname, gender (essential for determining the maximum number of donations that can be made in a year), weight, date of birth (and consequently, age), blood type, date of the last donation (to determine the next available donation date), and the number of donations already made in the current year. Consequently, the DONOR can make multiple donations of WHOLE BLOOD BAGS, the existence of which depends on the presence of a donation.
b) The generic donor donates their WHOLE BLOOD BAG, which the system, to ensure donor anonymity, stores using only an identifying ID, the respective blood type, and the date on which it was donated.
c) To be considered WHOLE BLOOD BAGS, the donated bags must be stored within one of the four BLOOD TRANSFUSION BANKS, identifiable by a unique ID, the name of the province, and they store all the currently available bags.
d) Once the bags are deposited within a transfusion bank, to use them, the system requires one of the many REQUESTS signed by the REQUESTING DOCTOR, who is identified in the database by a personal ID, name, surname, and manages various PATIENTS under treatment, listed with the same data, along with their blood type, essential for the correct transfusion procedure. The REQUEST, to be successful, must contain a unique identifying ID, the date it was prescribed by the doctor, the required blood type compatible with that of the patient, and the quantity of bags needed for the patient. The existence of the request depends on the system having a reference to a transfusion bank that will handle the need. DOCTORS can have many patients, but each patient refers to one and only one doctor for transfusion purposes. The ER diagram will include 6 strong entities (DONOR, BLOOD_BAG, BLOOD_TRANSFUSION_BANK, REQUEST, DOCTOR, PATIENT).

PS. If we want to be more precise, the BLOOD BAG is a weak entity because it cannot be identified solely by its attributes and must be linked to another entity.
